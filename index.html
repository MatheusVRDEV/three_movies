     Oppenheimer is a movie directed by Christopher Nolan, one of my favorite directors for make movies like Interestellar, Inception, Batman the dark knight and others.
     the art direction, the soundtrack and the actors make it very imersive experience and made me want to watch it again.
     In short, this is a very good movie.</p></div>

          This film is fantastic, the plot twist that hints at what's going to happen right from the start is very good, apart from the scenes, the colors, the music.
          easily one of the best movies I've ever seen, in my opinion it's aged like wine i recomend you to watch this masterpiece.

          <br>Easily one of the best movies I've seen in my life, it's literally in another universe.
Miles is very unique apart from the whole plot, each character that appears in the film has their own characteristic and they are all remarkable characters, the music choices were perfect.
in short, impeccable music and art direction + a universe with incredible characters make up the best marvel movie in my opinion.
